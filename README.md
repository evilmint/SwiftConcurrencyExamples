SPM projects were tested on Xcode 12.5 on macOS Catalina with [Swift 5.5 Development Snapshot 2021-05-11](https://swift.org/builds/development/xcode/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2021-05-11-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2021-05-11-a-osx.pkg). Xcode 13 requires using macOS 12, so using a toolchain from May solves the problem for some time.

iOS projects were tested on Xcode 13 on macOS Catalina.
